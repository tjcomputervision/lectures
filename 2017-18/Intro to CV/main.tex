Computer Vision Club

Welcome to the TJHSST Computer Vision Club! This club will occur every week Wednesday B Block. We strongly encourage you to attend as frequently as possible, as every week, we will be doing the following:


\begin{itemize}
  \item Constructive lecture (10-15 minutes)

  \item Questions/Answer Session (5 minutes)
  \item Related Lab (20 minutes)
  \item Monthly Competition (5-10 minutes, and continued for home)


\end{itemize}


\section{Competitions}

Each month, a monthly competition will be posted on the TJHSST Computer Vision  Club website. Students can email their code to tjcomputervision@gmail.com, and the team/individual with the most effective code will receive a prize. This way, students are motivated and excited to apply their newfound knowledge towards real life problems. We have decided that we will have a total of 8 different competitions related to the subject matter of that month.

\section{Website}
Most of our clubâ€™s information, including the lectures, powerpoints, and various other documents, can be found online, at TJComputervision.com (will be created). This way, all students will be able to be kept together even if they cannot come on a certain day. Below is our schedule till winter break. During winter break, large updates will be made to the website and competition structure, and afterwards, we will be offering a new competition via our website.
